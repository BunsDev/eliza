3. **Agent doesn't respond as expected**
   - Review `messageExamples` for better guidance
   - Adjust `style` and `bio` descriptions
   - Add more specific `knowledge` areas

### Testing Your Character

```bash
# Test locally first
bun start --character characters/your-character.json

# Check logs for errors
LOG_LEVEL=debug bun start --character characters/your-character.json

# Test specific platforms
bun start --character characters/your-character.json --client discord
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Choose a template** that matches your needs
2. **Copy the character file** to your characters folder
3. **Set up environment variables** for your chosen platforms
4. **Customize the personality** to match your vision
5. **Test thoroughly** before deploying
6. **Deploy and monitor** your agent's performance

**üí° Pro Tip**: Start with one platform and one character. Once it's working perfectly, expand to multiple platforms or create specialized characters for different use cases.

**üîí Security Note**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. Always use the `.env.example` template for sharing configuration requirements.
