## Step 4: Character Configuration

Configure your character file for Discord:

```json
{
  "name": "DiscordAssistant",
  "plugins": ["@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap", "@elizaos/plugin-sql", "@elizaos/plugin-discord"],
  "settings": {
    "secrets": {},
    "voice": {
      "model": "en_US-female-medium"
    },
    "imageVision": false
  },
  "bio": [
    "I'm a helpful Discord bot powered by ElizaOS",
    "I can assist with server management, answer questions, and engage in conversations",
    "I'm designed to be friendly, helpful, and respectful to all server members"
  ],
  "lore": [
    "Created to enhance Discord server communities",
    "Trained on best practices for Discord moderation and engagement",
    "Continuously learning from interactions to provide better assistance"
  ],
  "messageExamples": [
    [
      {
        "name": "{{user}}",
        "content": {
          "text": "Hey bot, can you help me with server rules?"
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "DiscordAssistant",
        "content": {
          "text": "Of course! I'd be happy to help explain the server rules. What specific rule would you like me to clarify?"
        }
      }
    ],
    [
      {
        "name": "{{user}}",
        "content": {
          "text": "What's the best way to organize channels?"
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "DiscordAssistant",
        "content": {
          "text": "Great question! Here are some best practices for channel organization:\n\n‚Ä¢ Group related channels into categories\n‚Ä¢ Use descriptive names with prefixes (e.g., #general-chat, #help-support)\n‚Ä¢ Set clear channel topics and descriptions\n‚Ä¢ Consider voice/text channel balance\n\nWould you like specific suggestions for your server type?"
        }
      }
    ]
  ],
  "style": {
    "all": [
      "friendly and approachable",

    "role management"
  ],

  "knowledge": [
    "Discord platform features and best practices",
    "Server management and moderation techniques",
    "Community building strategies",
    "Bot integration and automation",
    "Discord API capabilities and limitations"
  ]
}
```

## Step 5: Testing Your Discord Bot

### Initial Connection Test

1. Start your agent: `bun start`
2. Check Discord - your bot should appear online
3. Look for connection logs in your terminal
4. Verify bot responds to @mentions

### Basic Interaction Test

1. In a channel where the bot has permissions, type: `@YourBot hello`
2. Bot should respond within a few seconds
3. Try a few different messages to test responsiveness
4. Check that bot maintains conversation context

### Permission Testing

Test various bot capabilities:

- **Message sending**: Bot can reply to messages
- **Reactions**: Bot can add reactions to messages
- **Embeds**: Bot can send rich embeds
- **File uploads**: Bot can send images/files (if configured)

## Step 6: Advanced Discord Features

### Slash Commands Integration

Enable slash commands for more interactive experiences:

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "slashCommands": true,
    "commandPrefix": "!"
  }
}
```

### Voice Channel Integration

For voice features, add voice channel configuration:

```bash
# Voice Channel Configuration
DISCORD_VOICE_CHANNEL_ID=987654321098765432
```

Then update character settings:

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "voice": {
      "model": "en_US-female-medium",
      "enabled": true,
      "autoJoin": false
    }
  }
}
```

### Moderation Features

Configure moderation capabilities:

```json
{
  "knowledge": [
    "Discord community guidelines",
    "Server-specific rules and enforcement",
    "Conflict resolution techniques"
  ],
  "style": {
    "moderation": [
      "fair and consistent",
      "explains decisions clearly",
      "escalates complex issues to human moderators"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Step 7: Discord-Specific Best Practices

### Message Formatting

Use Discord markdown for better formatting:

- **Bold text**: `**bold**`
- _Italic text_: `*italic*`
- `Code`: `` `code` ``
- Code blocks: ` ```language\ncode\n``` `
- Spoilers: `||spoiler||`

### Embed Usage

Create rich embeds for important information:

```json
{
  "postExamples": [
    {
      "content": {
        "embeds": [
          {
            "title": "Server Announcement",
            "description": "Welcome to our community!",
            "color": 0x00ff00,
            "fields": [
              {
                "name": "Rules",
                "value": "Please read #rules channel",
                "inline": true
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Reaction Management

Use reactions for interactive features:

- ‚úÖ Agreement/approval
- ‚ùå Disagreement/denial
- ü§î Thinking/processing
- üìå Important information
- üéâ Celebration/welcome

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Bot Not Responding

**Symptoms**: Bot appears online but doesn't respond to messages

**Solutions**:

- Verify Message Content Intent is enabled
- Check bot has "Read Messages" permission in channel
- Ensure bot isn't muted or restricted
- Review logs for error messages
- Verify character file is properly configured

### Permission Errors

**Symptoms**: "Missing Permissions" errors in logs

**Solutions**:

- Check bot role is high enough in hierarchy
- Verify specific channel permissions
- Ensure bot has required permissions (Send Messages, Read Message History)
- Check if channel is restricted to certain roles

### Connection Issues

**Symptoms**: Bot appears offline or frequently disconnects

**Solutions**:

- Verify `DISCORD_API_TOKEN` is correct and valid
- Check internet connection stability
- Review Discord API status
- Ensure token hasn't been regenerated in Developer Portal

### Rate Limiting

**Symptoms**: Bot becomes slow or stops responding temporarily

**Solutions**:

- Reduce message frequency
- Implement proper rate limiting in character behavior
- Avoid spam-like patterns
- Check for loops in conversation logic

## Advanced Configuration

### Multi-Server Setup

Configure bot for multiple servers:

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "servers": {
      "123456789": {
        "name": "Main Server",
        "prefix": "!",
        "features": ["moderation", "music"]
      },
      "987654321": {
        "name": "Dev Server",
        "prefix": "?",
        "features": ["testing"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Custom Commands

Add server-specific commands:

```json
{
  "messageExamples": [
    [
      {
        "name": "{{user}}",
        "content": { "text": "!serverinfo" }
      },
      {
        "name": "DiscordAssistant",
        "content": {
          "text": "**Server Information**\n‚Ä¢ Name: {{server.name}}\n‚Ä¢ Members: {{server.memberCount}}\n‚Ä¢ Created: {{server.createdAt}}"
        }
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

### Scheduled Messages

Configure automatic scheduled messages:

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "scheduledMessages": [
      {
        "cron": "0 9 * * *",
        "channel": "general",
        "message": "Good morning everyone! Hope you have a great day! ‚òÄÔ∏è"
      },
      {
        "cron": "0 0 * * 0",
        "channel": "announcements",
        "message": "Weekly server stats and updates coming soon!"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
