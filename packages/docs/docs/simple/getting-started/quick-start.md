# 5-Minute Quick Start Guide

Get your first ElizaOS agent running in just 5 minutes! No coding required.

## 📋 What You'll Need

Before starting, make sure you have:

- A computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- Internet connection
- An AI API key (we'll help you get one)

## 🚀 Step 1: Install ElizaOS (2 minutes)

Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux) and run:

```bash
npx @elizaos/cli create my-first-agent
```

When prompted, select:

- **Project Type**: `project` (for a complete agent)
- **Template**: `basic` (simplest template)
- **Install dependencies**: `yes`

The installer will create your agent and set everything up automatically!

## 🔑 Step 2: Get Your AI Key (1 minute)

Your agent needs an AI service to think and respond. Choose one:

### Option A: OpenAI (Recommended for beginners)

1. Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Click "API Keys" → "Create new secret key"
4. Copy your key (starts with `sk-` prefix)

### Option B: Claude (Anthropic)

1. Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Go to "API Keys" → "Create Key"
4. Copy your key

### Option C: Local AI (Free, no API key needed)

- The agent will use a local AI model (slower but free)
- No additional setup required!

## ⚙️ Step 3: Configure Your Agent (1 minute)

1. Navigate to your agent folder:

   ```bash
   cd my-first-agent
   ```

2. Open the `.env` file in any text editor

3. Add your API key:

   ```
   # For OpenAI
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here

   # OR for Claude
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here

   # OR for Local AI - leave empty
   ```

4. Save the file

## 🎭 Step 4: Customize Your Agent (Optional - 30 seconds)

Open `agent/eliza.character.json` to customize your agent's personality:

```json
{
  "name": "Eliza",
  "description": "A helpful AI assistant",
  "modelProvider": "openai",
  "settings": {
    "voice": "alloy",
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini"
  },
  "bio": [
    "I'm here to help you with anything you need!",
    "I love learning new things and chatting with people."
  ],
  "style": {
    "all": ["friendly", "helpful", "encouraging"]
  }
}
```

Change the name, bio, and style to create your unique agent!

## ▶️ Step 5: Start Your Agent (30 seconds)

Run this command:

```bash
npm start
```

Your agent is now running! You'll see:

```
🤖 Agent "Eliza" is starting...
✅ Connected to OpenAI
🌐 Chat interface available at: http://localhost:3000
💬 Discord bot online (if configured)
🐦 Twitter bot online (if configured)
```

## 💬 Step 6: Chat with Your Agent

### Web Chat (Easiest)

1. Open your web browser
2. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
3. Start chatting with your agent!
